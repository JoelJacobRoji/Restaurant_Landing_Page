# 🍽️ Luna Rossa Restaurant Landing Page

A simple and elegant landing page for a restaurant, built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project showcases the restaurant’s brand, featured dishes, and contact information in a clean, modern, and responsive design.

# 🏫 About This Project

We originally created this project as part of our web development practice.  
The goal was to design a **professional, single-page restaurant website** using only front-end technologies (HTML & CSS).  

It helped us learn about:
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive layouts
- Navigation design
- Styling with CSS

This project also gave us hands-on experience in creating a **real-world styled landing page** that could be used for a small business or restaurant.
